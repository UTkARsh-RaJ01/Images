## Introduction: Carbon as the New Currency

India has committed to achieving **Net Zero by 2070**. With nearly **7% of global CO₂ emissions**, the government has introduced the **Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS)** to reduce emission intensity by **45% by 2030**.

The Indian Carbon Market (ICM) converts carbon emissions into a **tradable financial asset**, incentivizing industries to decarbonize while rewarding efficiency.

## 1. What is the Indian Carbon Market?

The **Indian Carbon Market (ICM)** is a regulatory, cap-and-trade framework designed to price greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

### Core Concept

- **Cap**: Government sets emission-intensity targets for industries  
- **Trade**:  
  - Emit less → earn **Carbon Credit Certificates (CCCs)**  
  - Emit more → buy CCCs to comply  

> **1 CCC = 1 tonne of CO₂ equivalent reduced**

### Mechanisms

1. **Compliance Mechanism** (mandatory for large industries)  
2. **Offset Mechanism** (voluntary for renewables, waste, forestry, etc.)

---

## 2. How Does It Work?

Carbon credits follow a strict **Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV)** process.

### Compliance Steps

1. Target setting by MoEFCC  
2. Emission monitoring via BEE-approved plans  
3. GHG emissions reporting (within 4 months)  
4. Third-party verification (ACVA, 2% materiality threshold)  
5. Credit issuance or surrender  
6. Trading on CERC-registered exchanges

### Credit Calculation
Credits = (Target Intensity − Achieved Intensity) × Total Production

## 3. Who Is Involved?

### Key Institutions

- **Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE)** – Administrator  
- **Ministry of Power (MoP)** – Sector & target recommendations  
- **Accredited Carbon Verification Agencies (ACVA)** – Auditors  
- **CERC** – Trading regulator  

### Obligated Industries (Phase 1)

- Aluminum  
- Cement  
- Chlor-Alkali  
- Fertilizer  
- Iron & Steel  
- Pulp & Paper  
- Petrochemicals  
- Petroleum Refineries  
- Textiles

## 4. When Is This Happening?

The framework is **already active**.

India’s grid is rapidly decarbonizing:
- 41% non-fossil capacity (2021–22)
- 57% by 2026–27
- 68% by 2031–32

Key milestones include:
- Target notification  
- Monitoring plan submission  
- Continuous data logging  
- Final reporting  
- Verification  
- Credit issuance & trading  

---

## 5. Why Does This Matter?

### Opportunity
- Monetize energy efficiency  
- Improve global competitiveness (CBAM readiness)

### Risk
- High penalties under Business-as-Usual scenarios  
- Rising cost of non-compliance

---

## Conclusion

The Indian Carbon Market marks a shift from **voluntary sustainability** to **mandatory financial accountability**. Understanding MRV and compliance timelines is now essential for long-term business viability.
